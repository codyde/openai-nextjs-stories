## OpenAI and NextJS 13 Demo 

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17350652/225122437-3468a34d-ca0a-40a4-832e-4abbe573f8dc.png)


This is a real simple demo of calling the OpenAI API and returning the data to a window. No streaming in this example - just an `await` for the return of a promise, not unlike my own life. This app uses NextJS 13 and the [new `app` directory](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta) routing, alongside [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and some [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 

Purpose of this was to give a starter for some easy future exploration on topics. 

### Running it 

You'll need an [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) which you can get from your [account details](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have this... 

Create an `.env` file in the root directory of this repo (or use secrets from any of the great web providers out there - Netlify, Vercel, Railway). If running local, run `npm run dev` and you should be off to the races! 

### Areas I'm exploring next... 

* Implement API streaming ([plenty of examples out there](https://github.com/Nutlope/twitterbio/blob/main/utils/OpenAIStream.ts); I just want to make sure I understand them fully first)
* Playing with creating a history of calls stored in [Supabase](https://www.supabase.com)
